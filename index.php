        <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU CHOOSE NATIVE PLANTS?</h2>
        <p>The Kentucky Exotic Pest Plant Council lists
        145 invasive plants with an additional 35
        plants on a watch list. These plants are causing
        ecological harm in natural areas throughout
        the state by reducing native plant diversity,
        altering ecosystem processes and negatively
        impacting wildlife. They are also costing a
        great deal of time and financial resources to
        control.</p>
        <p>Many of the invasive plants on our list have
        been used and promoted as ornamental
        plants in gardens and landscapes. Fortunately,
        there are a number of native Kentucky plants
        that offer similar attributes as well as other
        benefits. </p>
        <p>We offer this guide to make finding these
        alternatives and choosing the right native
        plants for your garden an easier task.
        However, this is not a finite list. There are
        many other options not listed here. Please
        support local garden centers that carry native
        species and encourage other garden centers
        to carry them. </p>
